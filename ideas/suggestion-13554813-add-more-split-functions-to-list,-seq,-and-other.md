Haskell has this Data.List.Split (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/split-0.1.1/docs/Data-List-Split.html) library which supports multiple strategies for list splitting. I think those functions can come in handy in some scenarios, plus they cannot be easily made by chaining other existing functions, therefore should be included in the core library?
