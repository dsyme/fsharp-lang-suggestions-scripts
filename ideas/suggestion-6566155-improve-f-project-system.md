I am not sure this is the right place to request this and I have no experience with the F# Project System.
But every time some important (and obvious) feature for a tool relating to F# is requested, the developers of the tool note that it is not possible or heavily restricted because of F#'s crappy project system.
For example, Folder Organization in Visual F# Power Tools: http://fsprojects.github.io/VisualFSharpPowerTools/folderorganization.html
Is there something that can be done about this? C# does not seem have to this problem. This is one of the most important and most urgent roadblocks for F# to become a truly first-class language in Visual Studio.

Good suggestion (and don’t forget you can contribute to the Visual F# Tools to help improve them).
The right place for this item is https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/category/30935-languages-f-tools
(This uservoice is for the F# language and core library. See fsharp.org/guides/engineering/issues for where to submit issues.)
Thanks!
